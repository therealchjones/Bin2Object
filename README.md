# Bin2Object

A BinaryReader and BinaryWriter which can serialize and deserialize arbitrary
binary formats into objects and vice versa. This is forked from
[excellent work performed by @djkaty and others](https://github.com/djkaty/Bin2Object/) with the
narrowed intention of supporting [my own fork of Il2CppInspector](https://github.com/therealchjones/Il2CppInspector). I recommend
instead using the original version and making contributions there.

See Tests\Tests.cs for usage examples.
